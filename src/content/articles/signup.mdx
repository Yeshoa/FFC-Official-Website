## Welcome to FFC Registration! 

Whether you’re **new to the FFC** or a **member**, this form has you covered:

- **New members**: complete **all sections** to join for the first time. <a href={LINKS.forms.newMember} target="_blank">Link here</a> 
- **Members**: skip straight to the sections you need to **update**. <a href={LINKS.forms.ffcMember} target="_blank">Link here</a> 

> Anyone who doesn’t submit will keep last season’s points and can still fight for a spot via playoffs.

## Form Navigation

Each section (except Confirmation) ends with a **menu** so you can jump around or finish early:

- **1 - Identity & Culture**  
- **2 - Visuals**  
- **3 - Squad Rotation**  
- **4 - Football History & Last Season**  
- **5 - Confirmation**

>Below some sections I’ve added a short explanation for every item so readers know **why** they’re filling it out and **how** it helps.

---

### Identity & Culture

**New teams must fill every field; returning teams can skip unchanged items.** This section establishes your nation’s identity and sets the tone for your roleplay.

* **Nation Name** (as in NationStates)
  We need your official name to ensure consistency across all materials and avoid duplicate entries.
* **Display Name**
  This is the name displayed during the events, on graphics, scoreboards, and Twitch overlays
* **Abbreviation** (2-3 letters)
  Short code to display in scoreboards.
* **Flag** (upload new if changed) - The game uses a 512x512 pixels file, so if it is smaller _(in width, unless your flag is vertical, which I don't recommend)_, it will be pixelated.
* **Cultural Notes** (language, traditions, lore)
  These details guide me to generate the players names and appearances, or other items.

### Visuals

Here you define how your nation **looks** on‑field and online.

* **Upload Logo** (SVG/PNG)
    Emblem for kits.
* **Upload Kit Textures** (Home & Away)
    Your home and away jerseys bring your colors to life ingame.
* **No graphics? Choose a design or describe your kit**
    If you don’t have files, you can choose a brand to outfit your team, and describe main features: stripes, patterns, themes, etc.

### Squad Rotation

Keep your roster up to date as players retire or are promoted.

* **Text field for squad notes**
    Insert in plain text the list of players, or the exact names you want the players to have, along with any details about their skills or appearance.
    <small class="text-gray-500">_Not needed if you send a file in the next item_</small>
* **Upload Roster File** (Excel/CSV/TXT or any file with new squad list)
    Upload a sheet instead, with your squad and details.
* **Extra Notes**
    Additional information we need to know.

> Rotating between 5 and 10 players between editions will add realism, but you are free to retain most of your previous roster. _However, in future editions, we may restrict repeated player participation over time._

<small class="text-gray-500">Choose: \[Finish] \[Go to Visuals] \[Go to History & Last Season]</small>

### Football History

This section powers both the **lore** and **score**.

* Share your nation’s Football History: championships, league, landmark matches.

* **Upload Files** (notes, screenshots, spreadsheets)
  
* **Text** if you have a **Dispatch** or lack files

<small class="text-gray-500">Choose: \[Finish] \[Go to Visuals] \[Go to Squad Rotation]</small>

> A Champions League can appear all of a sudden, you won't like to miss it!

### Confirmation

Finalize your submission:

* **Streaming Alias** (YouTube/Twitch/Kick)
    So we can recognize you during live broadcasts.
* **Submit**

---

**All set!**
Lock in your updates, apply new‑season points, and secure your place in the next Forest Cup!
