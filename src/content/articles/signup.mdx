## üî¢ Form Navigation

Each section (except Confirmation) starts with a **menu** so you can jump around or finish early:

- **1Ô∏è‚É£ Identity & Culture**  
- **2Ô∏è‚É£ Visuals**  
- **3Ô∏è‚É£ Squad Rotation**  
- **4Ô∏è‚É£ Football History & Last Season**  
- **‚úÖ Confirmation**

Below each section I‚Äôve added a short explanation for every item so readers know **why** they‚Äôre filling it out and **how** it helps:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identity & Culture

**New teams must fill every field; returning teams can skip unchanged items.** This section establishes your nation‚Äôs identity and sets the tone for your roleplay.

* **Nation Name** (as in NationStates)
  We need your official name to ensure consistency across all materials and avoid duplicate entries.
* **Display Name**
  This is the name displayed during the events, on graphics, scoreboards, and Twitch overlays
* **Abbreviation** (2‚Äì3 letters)
  Short code to display in scoreboards.
* **Flag** (upload new if changed)
* **Cultural Notes** (language, traditions, lore)
  These details guide me to generate the players names and appearances, or other items.

<small class="text-gray-500">Choose: \[Finish] \[Go to Visuals] \[Go to Squad Rotation] \[Go to History]</small>

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Visuals

Here you define how your nation **looks** on‚Äëfield and online.

* **Upload Logo** (SVG/PNG)
    Emblem for kits.
* **Upload Kit Textures** (Home & Away)
    Your home and away jerseys bring your colors to life in‚Äëgame.
* **No graphics? Describe your ideal colors & motifs**
    If you don‚Äôt have files, a written description ensures we capture your vision: stripes, patterns, themes, etc.

<small class="text-gray-500">Choose: \[Finish] \[Go to Squad Rotation] \[Go to History]</small>

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Squad Rotation

Keep your roster up to date as players retire or are promoted.

* **Text field for squad notes**
    Insert in plain text the list of players, or the exact names you want the players to have, along with any details about their skills or appearance.
    <small class="text-gray-500">_Not needed if you send a file in the next item_</small>
* **Upload Roster File** (Excel/CSV with new squad list)
    Upload a sheet instead, with your squad and details.
* **Extra Notes**
    Additional information we need to know.

<small class="text-gray-500">Choose: \[Finish] \[Go to Visuals] \[Go to History & Last Season]</small>

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Football History / Last Season

This section powers both the **lore** and the **points** system.

* **New teams:** Share your nation‚Äôs Football History: championships, league, landmark matches.
* **Returning teams:** Upload Last Season Results to earn new‚Äëseason points.

* **Upload Files** (dispatches, screenshots, spreadsheets)
  
* **Text** if you lack files

<small class="text-gray-500">Choose: \[Finish] \[Go to Visuals] \[Go to Squad Rotation]</small>

---

### ‚úÖ Confirmation

Finalize your submission:

* **Streaming Alias** (YouTube/Twitch/Kick)
    So we can recognize you during live broadcasts.
* **I‚Äôd like to host Forest Cup 2026** (*only Forestians*)
    If you have the venue, resources, or passion, tick here!
* **Submit**

---

**üéâ All set!**
Lock in your updates, apply new‚Äëseason points, and secure your place in the next Forest Cup!
