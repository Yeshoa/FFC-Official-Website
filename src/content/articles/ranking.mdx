## Overview

The FFC **Ranking** measures each nation’s overall strength by combining:

1. **Player ratings average**  
2. **Historical performance**  
3. **Community engagement** and **bonus activities**  

A higher ranking not only shows you’re one of the best teams, it also gives you **priority in group‐stage draws**, a key advantage in Forest Cup.

> Starting with Forest Cup 2026, the **top 24** ranked teams **(who have submitted their update form)** qualify **directly**.  
> All remaining nations enter a **playoff** for the final 8 spots.

## 🏅 Points Categories

We break down scoring into three main categories. Each category is **capped** or **weighted** so that no single area dominates your total score. (Values shown as variables for easy tweaking.)

### 1️⃣ Roleplay (max: `MAX_HISTORY_POINTS + MAX_PREV_EDITION_POINTS`)

* **History Points** (`0…H_MAX`):
  Rewarded for rich football roleplay, defined leagues, team lore, kit designs, dispatches, etc.
  *Subjective* but applied with clear criteria to maintain consistency.

* **Past Edition Results** (`0…E_MAX`):
  Points from last Forest Cup editions, with **diminishing returns**:

  * Edition −1: 100% of its points
  * Edition −2: 50%
  * Edition −3: 25%
  * Edition −4: 10%
  * Older: 0%

> **Suggestion:** To simplify, consider using a **decay factor** (e.g. multiply each prior edition by 0.5ⁿ) and cap the total at `MAX_PREV_EDITION_POINTS`.

### 2️⃣ Events (max: `MAX_EVENT_POINTS`)

* **Event Edition Results** (`0…EV_MAX`):
  Works like Past Edition Results, but for community events (poetry contests, mini‑tournaments, etc.).
* **Individual Event Scores** (`0…EV_MAX`):
  Each event awards points; we may apply a **normalization factor** so the top performer earns full credit and the rest scale accordingly.

### 3️⃣ Bonus (max: `MAX_BONUS_POINTS`)

* **Host Bonus** (`HOST_POINTS`):
  Automatic points for hosting a Forest Cup.
* **Easter Egg Discoveries** (`EGG_POINTS`):
  Find hidden surprises before the tournaments start to earn secret rewards.
* **Organizer’s Extra** (`XTR_POINTS`):
  Subjective rewards for community contributions (media coverage, translations, lore writing).

## ➕ Total Score & Tiers

Your **Total Score** = Roleplay + Events + Bonus
This becomes your **Ranking Value**, which places you into one of nine visual tiers:

| Tier | Score Range       | Description                               |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| F    | 0 – `T_E`         | Amateur level                             |
| E    | `T_E+1` – `T_D`   | Humble professionals                      |
| D    | `T_D+1` – `T_C`   | Solid pros, not yet standout              |
| C    | `T_C+1` – `T_B`   | Competitive contenders                    |
| B    | `T_B+1` – `T_A`   | Strong teams, past finalists/champions    |
| A    | `T_A+1` – `T_S`   | Title contenders                          |
| S    | `T_S+1` – `T_S+`  | Powerhouses                               |
| S+   | `T_S+1` – `T_X`   | Elite super‑teams                         |
| X    | `T_X+1` and above | Almost unbeatable; many 95+‑rated players |

> *Threshold constants (`T_E`, `T_D`, etc.) can be adjusted as we finalize scoring caps.*

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Finalize caps** (`H_MAX`, `E_MAX`, `EV_MAX`, `MAX_BONUS_POINTS`, `Tiers`).
2. **Publish** the ranking algorithm and example calculations for transparency.
3. **Update** the ranking page to display live point breakdowns per team.

By understanding and optimizing each category, you’ll maximize your nation’s strength, and your chances of lifting the Forest Cup trophy!
