## 🎨 Frontend Tasks

- [ ] **Make only one theme, no dark mode**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the dark: in tailwind classes.

- [ ] **Make Tailwind designs more responsive**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve layout for various screen sizes, mobile and tablets.

- [ ] **Use `<Image />` component where possible and optimize their size**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to optimize image rendering. If issues arise, consider moving image directories to `public/`.

- [ ] **Improve Final match cards**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Match card for final games should be more imposing.

## 🗃️ Backend

- [ ] **Complete match data**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Astro’s Content Collections for better content organization and markdown-powered routing.
  - [ ] `Lineups` for each team
  - [ ] `Cards` for each team
  - [ ] `Substitutions` from each team
  - [ ] `Stats` for each team
  - [ ] `Details` for each match
  
- ❌ **Create dynamic pages for each tournament (by ID/slug)** _Discarded: Using static versions instead_ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs collections in Markdown first. Each tournament should have its own route like `/tournament/fc-2022`.
  
- [ ] **Add assists to all 2022 matches**
