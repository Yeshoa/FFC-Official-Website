## üóÉÔ∏è Backend

- [ ] **Migrate existing TypeScript collections to Markdown**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Astro‚Äôs Content Collections for better content organization and markdown-powered routing. _(High priority, in progress)_

- [ ] **Create dynamic pages for each tournament (by ID/slug)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs collections in Markdown first. Each tournament should have its own route like `/tournament/fc-2022`.

## üß† General Tasks

## üé® Frontend Tasks

- [ ] **Make Tailwind designs more responsive**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve layout for various screen sizes, mobile and tablets.

- [ ] **Use `<Image />` component where possible**

- [ ] **Build reusable components for tournament pages**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standings tables, brackets, match grids ‚Äî all should be modular to simplify future tournament additions.
