## üóÉÔ∏è Backend

- ‚úÖ **Migrate existing TypeScript collections to Markdown**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Astro‚Äôs Content Collections for better content organization and markdown-powered routing.
  - ‚úÖ Members

  - ‚úÖ Tournaments - Should have a type and edition (FC uses years: 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026)
  - ‚ùå ~~Flags~~ _Discarded_
  
- ‚ùå **Create dynamic pages for each tournament (by ID/slug)** _Discarded: Using static versions instead_ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs collections in Markdown first. Each tournament should have its own route like `/tournament/fc-2022`.
