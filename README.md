## 🗃️ Backend

- [ ] **Complete match data**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Astro’s Content Collections for better content organization and markdown-powered routing.
  - [ ] `Lineups` for each team
  - [ ] `Cards` for each team
  - [ ] `Substitutions` from each team
  - [ ] `Stats` for each team
  - [ ] `Details` for each match
  
- ❌ **Create dynamic pages for each tournament (by ID/slug)** _Discarded: Using static versions instead_ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs collections in Markdown first. Each tournament should have its own route like `/tournament/fc-2022`.
  
- [ ] **Add assists to all 2022 matches**
